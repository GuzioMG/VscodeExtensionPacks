# Java A. I. O.

Java. All-in-One.

## About

Have you ever wanted a FULL Java development environment? Like... a complete one... with, with... I don't know... **JUST ABOUT *ANYTHING* YOU'LL EVER NEED FOR JAVA?**
- *Eclipse?* Nah, too laggy.
- *IntelliJ?* Too expensive, and the free version requires you to split into 3 separate editors (actual IntelliJ, WbStorm and Android Studio*), that would otherwise be packed together + coder's assistance (linting/recommendations/formatting/error checking - IntelliJ's main selling point) sucks in the free version.
- *NetBeans?* Are you kidding me?
- *VsCode?* Yeeeaaaah, open-source, and stuff, but I'll need to install all those extensions... **WAIT A SECOND**!

Are you a Java developer? I don't care, what Java developer. It's an extension pack for you, anyway!!!
Whenever you're a
Spring Boot developer,
a casual Java dev using Gradle, Maven or regular Java,
Tomcat developer,
Android app designer,
even a Minecraft modder (although they are going to have a rough time)
or whatever else,
it's an extension pack **just for *you***!

- Why do I put all of my extension packs under one repo? **Because I freaking can!**

> *Yes, I'm aware it's possible to just install the "Android Support" extension, because it's basically everything, what Android Studio is - that extensions + *paid* version of IntelliJ. And trust me, paying for it is worth it. Except, I never paid. I'm just comparing AS to IJ right now. And AS is free. And, thus, unless you have a paid version of IJ, you should install Android Studio.
